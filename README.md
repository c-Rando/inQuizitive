## Design Intent

```bash
This document aims to provide the user with a fun & interactive quiz regarding the United States of America. 
The quiz will ask 'questions', store the users 'score', and as a result will tally, and return the value to the user. At the end of a timer, or the failure to answer all questions correctly the program will 'terminate'. 
```
